// This file previously contained all note-related controller logic.
// It has been refactored to split functionalities into specialized files:
// - ./noteUtils.ts: For shared types, Joi schemas, and helper functions.
// - ./noteCRUDController.ts: For Create, Read, Update, Delete operations.
// - ./noteArchiveController.ts: For note archiving and unarchiving.
// - ./noteShareController.ts: For managing note sharing.

// This file is intended to retain or be a place for any "core" note functionality
// that does not fit into the above categories, or for high-level setup if needed.
// As per user request, this file should not be empty.

// console.log("noteController.ts (core) loaded.");

// Example of a placeholder for core setup or functionality.
// If specific core logic is identified, it can be implemented here.
export const initializeCoreNoteFeatures = () => {
  // This is a placeholder function.
  // Add any core initialization logic for notes module here if necessary.
  console.log("Core note features placeholder initialized.");
};

// Add other core-specific exports below if they arise.
// For now, the primary logic is delegated to the specialized controllers.
